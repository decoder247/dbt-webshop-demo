# Exercise Three

1. Implement the schema macro for your project
2. Implement another macro that converts the prices (currently in USD) to Euros
   - at what stage is it best to do this?
3. Write a unittest for the dim_customers_table (the table that we made that shows the number of orders each customer has made)
   - prove that the records there are what you would expect to see
   - compare the table with a query that returns the records you would expect to see
4. Stretch Goal: Find and apply a package that can audit your project
   - log each run
   - log each model run
5. Stretch Goal: Use the audited tables to create another table that shows some metrics/stats about the models run times
