# Intention of Book

The goal of this book is to help someone who has never used DBT (Data Build Tool) before, to get up and running with it and perform at a proficient level. To properly digest the contents of this book, it may help to have prior knowledge and/or experience in working with databases, or in particular some understanding of writing SQL. Additionally, some knowledge and/or experience in ETL (Extract Transform Load)/ELT (Extract Load Transform) will help. This book is not exhaustive, meaning that it is not meant to teach everything from A-Z about DBT. For that, please refer to DBT's [wonderful documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/). Also this book is not meant to help you become an expert, but can serve as a useful reference for core DBT functionality.

With that out of the way, I hope you find this useful!
